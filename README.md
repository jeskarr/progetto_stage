# My internship project
Practical application of what I researched on data visualization and infographics during my internship at Zucchetti SpA.

The repo includes:
- *Chart-chooser*: prototype tool for choosing the most suitable graph/chart based on the type of data and objective of visualization;
- *Infographic-helper*: prototype tool to help create infographics, especially helps to create an engaging story and identify its sections/main purpose;
- *Infographic-example (VERSIONE INTEGRATA)*: practical example of an infographic created using mainly HTML, CSS, JS and D3.js.

Detailed information about each component can be found in the **README.md** file located inside each directory.
