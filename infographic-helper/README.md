# Infographic-helper
This is a prototype tool designed to help users in the creation of infographics.
It uses an LLM to enhance the infographic's story by identifying missing elements or irrelevant content. Additionally, it helps to understand the structure of the infographic by dividing the story into sections and determining its overall objective. This information can then be used to find an effective layout for the infographic.
